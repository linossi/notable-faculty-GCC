                <p>Robert Laybourne was Greendale’s Associate Dean, and also in charge of the Air Conditioning Repair school annex. Holding this position made him a very intimidating and imposing figure. This reputation described him well, as he ran the annex with an iron fist. Laybourne also personally recruited candidates for his school from Greendale’s student body. His career and life were cut short, as he was murdered by his second-in-command, Murray. Before his death, Laybourne believed that Greendale student Troy Barnes was the finest candidate to become the ”truest repairman”, this constituting the motive for his murderer. May he rest in peace. </p>

                <p>In 1974, Russel Borchert founded Greendale as an institute of technology. At this time, the school was named ”Greendale Computery School”. At school, Borchert was an eccentric computer science professor. He was a wealthy computer programmer who dedicated himself to creating a machine who could process human emotion, using gold for circuitry, before he unexpectedly disappeared shortly after the school’s founding. In honor of his excellence, the campus named a building ”Borchert Hall”, which houses an Olympic sized swimming pool.  He resurfaced back in 2015, just in time to save the school from being demolished. He saved Greendale using his heaps of gold, collecting it from his AI machine, where he had used it as circuitry.   </p>

                <p>lroy Patashnick is Greendale’s Head of Information Technologies and Internet Connections. Patashnick is a former scientist and inventor. At one point, Patashnick was a leading pioneer in the field of Virtual Reality. He was also a high profile and in demand in the 1990’s, given by his intellectual and popular inventions.  When the novelty of VR wore off, his popularity faded. Due to this, Patashnick decided to reinvent himself here at Greendale Community College, by joining the ”Save Greendale Commitee" and became the head of the school’s I.T. department.   </p>
