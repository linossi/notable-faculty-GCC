Under his guidance, Greendale’s enrollment increased by 25%. His primary goal is to improve the school’s prestige and reputation, also striving to maintain a politically correct atmosphere on campus. On campus, Dean Pelton enjoys interacting with his aspiring students, and works hard to get them more involved in school functions.  </p>

                <p>Robert Laybourne was Greendale’s Associate Dean, and also in charge of the Air Conditioning Repair school annex. Holding this position made him a very intimidating and imposing figure. This reputation described him well, as he ran the annex with an iron fist. Laybourne also personally recruited candidates for his school from Greendale’s student body. His career and life were cut short, as he was murdered by his second-in-command, Murray. Before his death, Laybourne believed that Greendale student Troy Barnes was the finest candidate to become the ”truest repairman”, this constituting the motive for his murderer. May he rest in peace. </p>

                <p>In 1974, Russel Borchert founded Greendale as an institute of technology. At this time, the school was named ”Greendale Computery School”. At school, Borchert was an eccentric computer science professor. He was a wealthy computer programmer who dedicated himself to creating a machine who could process human emotion, using gold for circuitry, before he unexpectedly disappeared shortly after the school’s founding. In honor of his excellence, the campus named a building ”Borchert Hall”, which houses an Olympic sized swimming pool.  He resurfaced back in 2015, just in time to save the school from being demolished. He saved Greendale using his heaps of gold, collecting it from his AI machine, where he had used it as circuitry.   </p>

At one point, Patashnik was a leading pioneer in the field of Virtual Reality. He was also a high profile and in demand in the 1990’s, given by his intellectual and popular inventions.  When the novelty of VR wore off, his popularity faded. Due to this, Patashnik decided to reinvent himself here at Greendale Community College, by joining the ”Save Greendale Commitee" and became the head of the school’s I.T. department.   </p>

As Dr. Duncan is a man of empathy, he left his job in America to travel back to England to help and accompany his ill mother. When returning to America, he was no longer professor at Greendale, and instead decided to join the ”save Greendale committee".   </p>

                <p>Benjamin Franklin ”Ben” Chang is a long-time employee of Greendale Community College, who has worked in various capacities. When he first arrived at Greendale, he was hired as a Spanish teacher, but due to undisclosed reasons, he was fired. Because of Greendale's strong will to help students reinvent themselves, Chang was allowed to enroll as a music student, in order to earn a legitimate teaching degree. At home, Chang fought with difficult problems, and even became homeless, eventually taking up his residence in Greendale’s Ventilation System. When our strong-willed and empathetic Dean heard about his situation, Chang was given the job as security guard. When he unexpectedly became ill with ”changnesia”, he had to leave his job. To help Chang get through his tough time, Greendale decided to employ him at ”Shirley’s Sandwich shop”.  He later revealed that he never actually had ”changnesia”, and was put in a work-release program, employed at Greendale once again as our math teacher.  </p>
