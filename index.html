                <p>Craig Isidore Pelton is the current dean of Greendale Community College. At Greendale, Pelton is a well-meaning and hard-working administrator. Under his guidance, Greendale’s enrollment increased by 25%. His primary goal is to improve the school’s prestige and reputation, also striving to maintain a politically correct atmosphere on campus. On campus, Dean Pelton enjoys interacting with his aspiring students, and works hard to get them more involved in school functions.  </p>

                <p>Robert Laybourne was Greendale’s Associate Dean, who was also in charge of the Air Conditioning Repair school annex. Holding this position has made him a very intimidating and imposing figure. This reputation describes him well, as he ran the annex with an iron fist. Laybourne also personally recruited candidates for his school from Greendale’s student body. His career and life were cut short, as he was murdered by his second-in-command, Murray. Before his death, Laybourne believed that Greendale student Troy Barnes was the finest candidate to become the ”truest repairman”, this constituting the motive for his murderer. May he rest in peace. </p>

                <p>In 1974, Russel Borchert founded Greendale as an institute of technology. At this time, the school was named ”Greendale Computery School”. At school, Borchert was an eccentric computer science professor. He was a wealthy computer programmer who dedicated himself to creating a machine who could process human emotion, using gold for circuitry, before he unexpectedly disappeared shortly after the school’s founding. In honor of his excellence, the campus named a building ”Borchert Hall”, which houses an Olympic sized swimming pool.  He resurfaced back in 2015, just in time to save the school from being demolished. He saved Greendale using his heaps of gold, collecting it from his AI machine, where he had used it as circuitry.   </p>
